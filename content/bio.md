Here is Jian Tang (Chinese: 唐健). 

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at RMIT University, supervised by [Dr. Xiaoyu (Shaw) Xia](https://xiaoyushawxia.github.io/homepage/).

Prior to this, I received my M.S. degree from the School of Big Data & Software at Chongqing University in June 2025, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiuhua Li](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/4507.htm), and B. S. degree from Hunan University of Technology and Business in June 2022. 

My research focuses broadly on federated learning, edge intelligence, and network & system  security, with particular emphasis on privacy protection mechanisms, security coordination, and efficiency optimization. 
My work aims to develop federated learning and edge intelligence systems that balance efficiency, privacy protection, and robustness under resource-constrained and untrusted environments, providing secure and reliable technical support for large-scale intelligent applications.
Any form of collaboration is welcome; if you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via email.
