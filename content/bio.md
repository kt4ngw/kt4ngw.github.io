Here is Jian Tang (Chinese: 唐健). 

I received my M.S. degree from the School of Big Data & Software at Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in June 2025, supervised by [Prof. Xiuhua Li](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/4507.htm).

Prior to Chongqing University, I received my B. S. degree from Hunan University of Technology and Business in June 2022. 

Any form of collaboration is welcome, so if you are interested in my research, please email me.
