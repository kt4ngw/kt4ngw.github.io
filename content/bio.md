Here is Jian Tang (Chinese: 唐健). 

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in School of Computing Technologies at RMIT University, supervised by [Dr. Xiaoyu (Shaw) Xia](https://xiaoyushawxia.github.io/homepage/).
Prior to this, I received my M.S. degree from the School of Big Data & Software at Chongqing University in June 2025, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiuhua Li](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/4507.htm), and B. S. degree from Hunan University of Technology and Business in June 2022. 

My research focuses broadly on **federated learning**, **edge intelligence**, and **network & system security**, with particular emphasis on privacy protection mechanisms, security coordination, and efficiency optimization. 
Any form of collaboration is welcome; if you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via email.
