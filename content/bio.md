Here is Jian Tang. 

I am a current M.S. student in the School of Big Data & Software at Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, supervised by [Prof. Xiuhua Li](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/4507.htm).

Prior to Chongqing University, I received my B. S. degree in engineering in June 2022 from Hunan University of Technology and Business. 

Any form of collaboration is welcome, so if you are interested in my research, please email me.
